# Features & Technical Challenges

Constructed User Auth by sending 

Integrated IEX (Third Party) API by sending an HTTP query with a secured API key for real-time U.S. stock market data

Created User Portfolio Dashboard that updates off of our Redux stores state
User Watchlist - Users can add companies to a watchlist so that they can track specific companies that interest them
Company Profile - Users can see detailed information about an individual company, including detailed financial information and stats. Users can also buy, sell, and watch stocks from this page
Buying/Selling Shares - Users are able to purchase and sell company shares. Their balance and portoflio both update in real time alongside their trading decisions
Search - Users can get instant live search results of company symbols as they are typing the company name or symbol

Employed Docker container tooling to ensure code is shipped reliably across all platforms
